# Rubik_Cube_Challenge
This is the repo for the Cotta &amp; Cush Software Engineering Internship Challenge


Documentation of the Code Implementation:

1. The mathematical analysis are implemented into code using Python 2.7.13

2. As a result of this, Python 2.7 must be installed before the code can be ran from the Command Prompt or Terminal.

3. To access the code for Question 1.1, the python file is 'rubik_cube.py' and run as 'python rubik_cube.py'.

4. For Question 1.2, the python file is 'hidden.py' and run as 'python hidden.py'.

5. For Question 1.3, the python file is 'faces.py' and run as 'python faces.py'.

6. For Question 1.4, the python file is 'create_rubik.py' and run as 'python create_rubik.py'.
